# Pirate Game

### Project by Miki, Dan, and Nikolaj.

###### This project is a mandatory assignment in Game Development 2017

The idea of this game is that you are a drunken, angry, pirate whom is seeking the ultimative treasures. In order to find this treasure, you go on a very long trip on the seven seas, where you have to plunder gold and avoid the navy ships until you are strong enough to fight them.

## WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR PIRATE? YOUR CAPTAIN NEEDS YOU!
